> **Note:**  
> - Power pins (3.3V and 5V) supply power to your circuits.
> - Ground pins (GND) are needed to complete electrical circuits.
> - GPIO pins can be programmed to control LEDs, sensors, motors, and more.
> - Special function pins like I2C, UART, and SPI allow communication with other devices.
